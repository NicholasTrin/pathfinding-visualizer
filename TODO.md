1. Allow user to input map variables: height, width, and tile probabilities
2. Implement algorithms:
   1. Breadth First Search (BFS)
   2. Dijkstra 
3. Allow user to select desired algorithm to be executed (A*, BFS, Dijkstra)
4. Refactor code to execute from multiple algorithms (listed above)
   1. Simulation.py requires generalizing to run multiple algorithm types
5. Implement different tile types for map, each associated with different costs
