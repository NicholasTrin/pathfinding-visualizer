The program provides a visual representation of different types of search algorithms carried out on a map. 
The map is pseudo-randomly generated and populated with varying tile types.
The tile types are divided into passable and impassable.
Passable tiles vary in their cost to pass them.
For example, blue tiles (water) cost two to pass through whereas white tiles (empty space) cost one.
Impassable tiles are walls and have no variety.
